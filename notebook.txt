Things I need in llm query output:
1. Title box
    - save query button next to that
2. English text prompt used. uneditable
3. The sql query used
    - make it a clickable black text with a line underneath it. When it is clicked, 
      the div opens up by expanding the line vertically
    - button or dropdown to show sql query
    - a div that allows the user to edit the query
        - and hit save
            a title must be entered for the query to be saved
5. The run again button
6. The save table button
    - maybe a dropdown with different table formats?
7. The table itself


To Do as of 9/10/2024
1. Add buttons to the run-query div
    - close without saving button
    - functionality of "Run again" button
    - Functionality of "Save table" button
    - Abstract out the run-query div javascript functions into their own file
    - Abstract out the run-query div into its own file or copy and paste into each query related file
